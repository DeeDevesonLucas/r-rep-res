The main aim of this workshop is to set you on the right path of making your research more reproducible and shariable. Reproducible research means that future you and anyone else will be able to pick up your analysis and reproduce the same results including figures and tables. Reproducible research also implies well documented reasearch, your code should be well commented and the reasons behind functions and methods should be well explained through out the analysis. The communication aspect should not be after thought, but stays with your analysis as you are going through it. Rmarkdown is a way of literal programing that keeps code and words and sentences together. The other important aspect that goes hand and hand with reproducibility is ability to easily collaborate and share your analysis. We are going to repurpose git version cotrol tool and leverage GitHub remote hosting provider for managing and sharining our work. Git + GitHub will provide very powerful way for global collaboration and exposure of your work. In this workshop we are going to verstion control our work and push it to github, which can then be accessible by your collaborators and supervisors. Git + GitHub should become integral part of your workflow. The RRR course given by the Monash Bioinformatics Platform for the Monash Data Fluency initiative. Our teaching style is based on the style of The Carpentries. HTML versoin PDF version 0.1 Learning outcomes Attendees will learn how to: write vanilla markdown, Rmarkdown and bookdown documents use knitr, rmarkdown and bookdown R packages to build various document types including PDF, HTML and DOCX create reproducible Rmarkdown documents leveraging .Rproj and .RData include inline citation and full references list in to Rmarkdown document using .bib files create presentations from Rmarkdown documents that include R code work with git version control tool create reproducible and “backed up” analysis via remote repositories (e.g github) 0.2 Workshop description This workshop is an introduction to writing and communicating research using Rmarkdown. Rmarkdown is an easy way to create documents that include your R code and its output such figure and tables. Rmarkdown is a single documents that can be “knitted” and shared as various document types such as PDF and HTML. Rmarkdown supports scientific writing such as use of citations and figure cross-referencing. Rmarkdown can also be used to create presentations that include your R code and its output. We will also cover bookdown, which is an extension to Rmarkdown that allows creation of larger documents such as books with multiple chapters. In this workshop we will also cover git version control tool that can help with organising and “checkpointing” Rmarkdown documents, associated R code and data. Git is not a back up system, but it does allow one to retrieve older versions of your work. Git together with remote repositories like GitHub can provide centralised location for your research. All together Rmarkdown, git and github can enable reproducible research that is visiable and accessible by greater public including supervisors and management. 0.3 Prerequisite This is an introductory level workshop, however some prior exposure to R and familiarity with RStudio is assumed. 0.4 Keywords R Rmarkdown communication reproducibility git and github 0.5 Schedule 10:00-10:30am (30 minutes) Welcome and warm up 10:30-12:00pm (1.5 hours) Rmarkdown 12:00-1:00pm (1 hour) lunch 1:00-3:00pm (2 hours) More Rmarkdown 3:00-3:15pm (15 minutes) Tea break 3:15-4:45pm (1.5 hours) Even more Rmarkdown 4:45-5:00pm (15 minutes) Warm down 0.6 References R Markdown: The Definitive Guide knitr knitr vs rmarkdown vs bookdown Happy Git and GitHub for the useR 0.7 Authors and copyright This course is developed for the Monash Bioinformatics Platform by: Paul Harrison Adele Barugahare Kirill Tsyganov This work is licensed under a CC BY-4: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

["introduction-to-rmarkdown.html", "1 Introduction to Rmarkdown 1.1 Challenge: Introduction 1 1.2 Rmarkdown ecosystem 1.3 Setup 1.4 Challenge: Introduction 2 1.5 Useful tips 1.6 References", " 1 Introduction to Rmarkdown Rmarkdown has become much more then just embedding R code into a document. It enables construction of very sophisticated document types from plain text files. Rmarkdown file can become pdf docuemnts and a static website at the same time. It can turn your analysis scattered across several different Rmarkdown documents into a single multi-paged books with cross-referencing and citations, let’s call it a thesis or a paper or a course book. And with essentially no effort you can change from “rendering” your Rmarkdown into presentation slides instead of web-page, ready for a conference in little time. Rmarkdown is a natural evolution of vanilla markdown, backed and extended by the ecosystem discussed next. Markdown is relativelly small and simple language for writing plain text documents that are easy-to-write and easy-to-read, but greatly enhanced by pandoc tool. Any Rmarkdown documents is broken into three main parts: YAML header The R chunks markdown - plain text Those are different parts of the document that all work together to form - render a final document. Each one of those parts can be customised with further options, which will cover later in the book. 1.0.1 YAML header YAML header will always seat at the very top of your Rmarkdown document and it starts and ends with triple dash symbols, ---. Note that YAML is indentation and space sensitive, meaning you need to be rather strict about amount of indentation you use and text strings will need to be quoted. --- title: &quot;Hello world&quot; author: &quot;Kirill&quot; date: &quot;17 June 2019&quot; output: html_document --- 1.0.2 The R chunks These are special parts of the document that hold code that can be executed inline of the Rmarkdown document. R chunks are highly customisable via chunk options. We will spending a lot of time in the course working with code chunks and different options types. ```{r} plot(mtcars) ``` 1.0.3 Everything else is plain old markdown # Have I been Marked Down? 1.1 Challenge: Introduction 1 5 minutes 1. What file extention should we typically use for saving our Rmarkdown files? answer link 2. What document types can be produced (compiled) from Rmarkdown? 3. Will I have to learn more “languges” to use Rmarkdown (discussion question)? The short answer is no. Learning and writing Rmarkdown will take you a very long way. The longer answer is yes. At some point in the future you might want to very sophisticated documents and for that you’ll most certainly will need at least tiny amount of html + css knowledge and maybe some knowledge about LaTeX (I’ve yet to learn a single thing about LaTeX - so far so good :D ) check out this bit of Rmarkdown 1.2 Rmarkdown ecosystem Rmarkdown has relativelly complicated ecosystem. It includes several different R packages. Most of those packages wrap other existing tools, written by different people, thereby providing an “easy” way to interface with the tools via R language. A large part of the ecosystem exists thanks to pandoc tool. 1.2.1 Pandoc Pandoc is a stand alone tool (command line tool) that one can run in the terminal to convert markdown documents to other documents types including html, pdf and MS docs. Since vanilla markdown is pretty simple in what it can produce, pandoc added whole lot of “features”, additional marking tags, that one can use to build more elaborate documents from plain text. 1.2.2 YAML This is stand along language that is used in variety of places, with main advantage to it is that it can be easily ready by humans as well easily parsed by computer. A lot of the time YAML can be used ad a configuration file. This is example how it is used with Rmarkdown. We will talk about YAML in more depth in a different section. In brief we will use YAML to set documents appearance and link additional files with the documents, such as bibliographies. 1.2.3 LaTeX ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 1.2.4 Knitr As was mentioned before we are using pandoc to convert markdown to other document types. knitr provides function to convert Rmarkdown files into vanialla markdown, which then in turn can be converted by pandoc into html document for example. Some of the things that knitr does includes R code execution and assembling the results into markdown. 1.2.5 Rmarkdown An rmarkdown R package will convert .Rmd files into other format types. Under the hood it will use pandoc to do so. The main function that we are concerned with is rmarkdown::render() which will call knitr::knit() when required. 1.2.6 Bookdown A bookdown R package enhances rmarkdown by enabling multi-page documents e.g books and easy cross-referencing. 1.2.7 Others These are more R packages that enable more things via Rmarkdown. xaringan blogdown thesisdown 1.3 Setup We will need to install these packages. Let’s install these packages packages &lt;- c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;tinytex&quot;) install.packages(packages) 1.4 Challenge: Introduction 2 2 minutes 1. Now is a good time to tweak your RStudio to your needs. change font size change themes and backgroung color rearrange panels 2. Please turn off “Restore .RData into workspace at startup” in “Tools -&gt; Global Options”. 1.5 Useful tips don’t attempt to compile to pdf_document until absolutelly necesserary. LaTeX engine that is used for Rmarkdown to pdf conversion known to have issues with aligning figures and tables. This typically causes figures and tables overflow to next pages and general text misalignment. Get your content written first, intermidiate compilation to html_documents are totaly fine, before worrying about technical issues don’t save data into .RData, this will make your work less reproducible 1.6 References related stackoverflow question a- Presentation slides on Rmarkdown ecosystem "],
["vanilla-markdown.html", "2 Vanilla Markdown 2.1 Vanilla tags 2.2 Practice vanilla markdown 2.3 Challenge: Markdown 101", " 2 Vanilla Markdown The original (vanilla) version of Markdown invented by John Gruber defines a handful of tags, discussed shortly. Rmarkdown isn’t the only flavour, CommonMark that tries to unify all the different flavours and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) which mainly enhances content appears on github site all via pandoc in one way or another. 2.1 Vanilla tags File └── New File └── R Markdown title = &quot;Learning Rmarkdown&quot; author = &quot;Me&quot; select document type HTML to build (compile) the document press knitr button or ctrl+alt+k to save as .Rmd file I know I said vanilla, but we are launching an Rmarkdown file. It doesn’t matter for two reasons, under the hood Rmarkdown will always be converted to vanilla markdown and we are simply using RStudio to write text, can be anything. From now onward we are going to start using knitr is an R package that does all the magic of converting and running your R markdown and R code respectively. There actually not that much to core (vanila) of markdown essentially all of it can be summarised below # Header1 ## Header2 ### Header3 Paragraphs are separated by a blank line. Two spaces at the end of a line produces a line break. Text attributes _italic_, **bold**, `monospace`. Horizontal rule: --- Bullet list: * apples * oranges * pears Numbered list: 1. wash 2. rinse 3. repeat A [link](http://example.com). ![Image](Image_icon.png) &gt; Markdown uses email-style &gt; characters for blockquoting. 2.2 Practice vanilla markdown Now it’s just a matter of learning some of the markdown syntax. Let’s delete all current text from the opened document except the YAML header and type this new text in Hello world, I'm learning R markdown ! and pressing the knit HTML button. Hello world, I&#39;m learning R markdown ! Not much happened. This is because we didn’t mark our text in any way. You can put as much text as you want and it will appear as is, unless “specially” marked to look differently. Now add the # symbol at the start of the line and press the knit HTML button again. We’ll be pressing this button a lot! For those who like keyboard short cuts use ctrl+shift+k instead. # Hello world, I&#39;m learning R markdown ! How about now? A single hash symbol made it whole lot bigger didn’t it? We’ve marked this whole line to be the header line. Now make three new lines with the same text, but different numbers of # symbols, one, two and three respectively and keep pressing the Knit HTML button # Hello world, I&#39;m learning R markdown ! ## Hello world, I&#39;m learning R markdown ! ### Hello world, I&#39;m learning R markdown ! This is how you can specify different headers type using markdown. Remember that vanilla markdown is comprised entirely of punctuation characters. 2.3 Challenge: Markdown 101 5 minutes 1. How to mark text so that it appears underlined? answer link 2. Can markdown replace html (discussion question)? It has replaced html and latex in documention and communication of results. My feeling is that data science ecosystem heavily rotates around markdown. But html, pdf and latex in this context are simply communication and sharing medium. On would not want to replace html + css for large website project "],
["rmarkdown-1.html", "3 Rmarkdown 3.1 Why Rmarkdown again? 3.2 Embedding R code 3.3 Challenge: code chunks 3.4 References", " 3 Rmarkdown In Markdown section I’ve showed you how to start new Rmarkdown document in RStudio, but lets briefly recap how we do that. File └── New File └── R Markdown title = &quot;Learning Rmarkdown&quot; author = &quot;Me&quot; select document type HTML to build (compile) the document press knitr button or ctrl+alt+k to save as .Rmd file 3.1 Why Rmarkdown again? The reason that we are using Rmarkdown is because there is no alternative, really? Really. Irrespective of the programming language used we’ll have to write code and one way or anther you’ll be writing notes and comments that will go along with that chunk of code. It makes sense to keep those comments (text) close to the code, inside the same file ideally. That idea isn’t novel I and hope that all of you comment your code well. Common commenting characters: # /* */ // But the comments are never seem in the output and can only be accessed by one looking into the source. But wouldn’t it be nice if we can see the code, the output and the comments together? This type approach is supper common and supper useful when you working with some data and you are trying to convey some message to a different person (people) by means of examples and/or illustration of the analysis flow. Not only one can read your notes about the analysis, that are placed exactly next the piece of code or data by the way, but one can also see the code that one wrote for that analysis. 3.2 Embedding R code RStudio is pretty good it templates our Rmd file a bit. Lets delete all the text past these lines. --- title: &#39;Learning Rmarkdown&#39; author: &#39;Kirill&#39; date: &#39;21/06/2019&#39; output: html_document --- ```{r setup, include=FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) ``` I’m going to explain knitr::opts_chunk bit shortly, but for now let’s skip that part and move on to embedding R code into the document. Any R code has to be inside “special” block - chunk, this one ```{r} ``` Little r there specifies the “engine”, which interpreter to use to “understand” the text inside that chunk. Here we are saying use R engine (language) to evaluate the code. The list of languages is rather long actually, but for now let’s only focus on R language, otherwise it becomes even harder to explain Rmarkdown. As I’ve hinted in the introduction section is so ubiquitous that you can’t avoid it anymore. Let’s write our first bit of R code inside the Rmarkdown document. First we need to start a new R chunk, which can be done in either of three ways: simply type it out press insert button at the top of the window ctrl+alt+i Let’s start with a simple print() statement and print Hello world, I'm learning Rmarkdown ! string, except we are going to split it between two variable ```{r} a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) ``` Note that each chunk can be run independently in the console by pressing ctrl^enter or little green arrow. Each code chunk is highly customisable via chunk options. We are going to learn a few today, but we won’t be able to cover all of them. You probably never going to use some of them, but as long as you know what to look for you’ll be able to search for then on the internet. Note that all chunk options have a default value, by not specifying the options you are simply using the default option. General layout of any chunk is ``` {r chunk_name, options} ``` Note a couple of things, there isn’t a comma between r and chunk_name. Not sure why this is.. Also note that chunk_name is optional, you can skip it, as we have in earlier examples. Naming chunks is good idea to conceptually label the chunk as to what it does, but also we you are going to build more sophisticated documents you’ll be able to selectively include chunks by refer to them by the chunk name. Lets start off with these three chunk options: echo show what has been typed in i.e show the code eval evaluate or execute that code results hide resulting output These allow us fine level control over the final document. Think about who are generating the document for and what type of information you need to share. Sometimes we might want to show the code, but not execute it and other times we might just want to execute it and share the results, e.g plot, without actually showing the code. Let’s start with echo = TRUE and eval = TRUE. ```{r echo = T, eval = T} a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) ``` a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) ## [1] &quot;Hello world, Im learning Rmarkdown !&quot; Now let’s turn echo off, echo=FALSE. ```{r echo = F} a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) ``` ## [1] &quot;Hello world, Im learning Rmarkdown !&quot; Okay, we don’t see our original print() statement. And now let’s pass eval=FALSE options instead ```{r eval = F} a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) ``` a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) Now we see the code, but not the output. The difference between echo and results is subtle, at least in my head. Let’s consider the following example. ```{r echo = T, eval = F, results = &#39;asis&#39;} a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) ``` ```{r} ab ``` a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) ab ## [1] &quot;Hello world, Im learning Rmarkdown !&quot; Let’s turn results = 'hide' ```{r echo = T, eval = F, results = &#39;hide&#39;} a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) ``` ```{r} ab ``` a &lt;- &#39;Hello world,&#39; b &lt;- &#39;Im learning Rmarkdown !&#39; ab &lt;- paste(a, b) print(ab) [1] “Hello world, Im learning Rmarkdown !” ab ## [1] &quot;Hello world, Im learning Rmarkdown !&quot; And now we only see print() statement and no output. 3.3 Challenge: code chunks 3 minutes 1. Go through all of your code so far and give each chunk a name ``` {r chunk_name, options} ``` 3.4 References Here is nice cheatsheet that has comprehensive cover of all the options you can pass in.

["git-and-github-introduction.html", "4 Git and GitHub introduction 4.1 git no nos 4.2 Starting with git 4.3 Which files to commit? 4.4 Github introduction", " 4 Git and GitHub introduction When you are rock climbing you want to set your anchors often How often will depend on your experience and desire not to fall Git commit like your vertically handing off 70 feet rock Git is one of many tool, but very popular, that was design for tracking versions of software development - a.k.a version control tool. While it hasn’t been strickly design with scientific research projects in mind we will happily repurpose git to help us stay on top of our research projects. Git will help us: organise our directory structure create “milestones” a.k.a git commits make apparent which parts of the projects (files) are important git will also help us to share our work and last but not least git will help us collaborate Figure 4.1: This is an example of git version cotrol vs DIY versioning via filesystem Git is a command line tool however you don’t have to learn command line just yet. There are a few git clients available - graphical user interface (GUI) tool / applications that we can use instead of learning command line. We are going to use RStudio which has good git support and therefore Rstudio will be our git client. One rather important note about git clients, most (all) clients will “simply” form a git commands as you would type it out and execute on command line. This means a couple of things: one can use mixture of clients and command line without any issues. For example if one needs more complicated git command one could run it on the command-line. if you need to do a more complicated git kung fu you might only find solution for command line and then it’ll be up to you to figure out how to work it into your client An interesting note about command line git usage noted in Happy Git with R book; One might think that git via cli is “better”, however it is more important to get the work done and have it version controlled rather then fight with the cli. Do take the simplest and quickest path to get your work version controlled. No one will care which client you are using in the end. 4.1 git no nos no spaces in file names (this goes beyond git) no git repositories inside an existing git repository 4.2 Starting with git In Rstudio you can only start working with git when you have an existing Rproject directory 4.2.1 Configuring git You will most certainly forget this step, because you only need to do it once per computer (or new installation of git). Git will remind if you haven’t done these steps. These are our very first step in being organise and ready for future collaboration. We need to let git know our name and email address, which will get stored in configuration file. Unfortunately RStudio doesn’t have support for setting up config. It was probably not worth implementing given that you only really do it once. We will have to use terminal (command line) just this once. Let’s open up a terminal and run a couple of git commands Tools -&gt; Terminal -&gt; New Terminal git config --global user.name kirill git config --global user.name &quot;kirill.tsyganov@monash.edu&quot; One can then double check that all was set correctly bu running this command. git config --global --list 4.2.2 Intiating git repository In git jargon repository is simply your working folder (folders sometimes also called directories). In our case Rproject folder == Rproject directory == git repository == git repo Let’s initate git repository Tools -&gt; Version Control -&gt; Project Setup -&gt; Git/SVN And select from the drop down options “Version control system” Git The command line equivalent is navigating to your project directory and running git init 4.2.3 First commit Let’s make our first commit, use drop down menu as indicated on the image below to select commit option You should see a new window poped up Then we are going to add three files .gitignore project.Rproj learning_markdown.Rmd Write a commit message and press commit. And this is how happy git commit looks like The commit message is rather important. Remember that commit message is: a message to a future you a message to your supervisor a message to all other external people Those commit messages are means of communications e.g “fixed figure 1 legend” “added new paragraph to chapter 1” “I bloody hate this project delete everything, starting from scratch” Good thing is, as long as you “tracking” your deletes you can always go back to them and check what you have deleted and revert some of those changes back when needed. However in this workshop we won’t be covering much of that. Also note that commit message don’t have to long, and can be as short as one work - “update2”, but at the same time well written commit message will help you and other. http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#commit-best-practices 4.3 Which files to commit? This section will be extended in the future release, but I highly recommend reading this article, specifically section 10: Which files to commit from here 4.4 Github introduction make a diagram where git at the center and arrows out to different places gitlab, github, bitbucket personal server, even the same comoputer but different “bare” folder (this isnt “safe” nor accessible by others, but totaly possible) briefly talk about github things like PR, gitissues, staring and watching projects, collaborators and update dates/commits as a proxy of how active the project is. also do check which files typically being changed. Also mention the fact that it is very explicit when the project was started (initiated) how much work has gone into it (commits history) and roughly time frame and intervals of work mention at some point README file as a general means of “silent” communication then README.md and index.html as “special” files. README.md is the front page - apperance for your project. One can have multiple README.md files in subdirectories if necessary. in simple workflow and collaborations git merge will work just fine. git will happy merge two different branches i.e all files in one location with all files in the other location if no two file conflict "],

You can also use ctrl+enter to do the same with the keyboard short cut. ```{r} plot(mtcars) ``` plot(mtcars) This is great, but a bit too much information, lets just focus on number of cylinders and hourse power. ```{r} plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$hp) ``` plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$hp) We can add a bit more information to our plot, to make more self descriptive. ```{r} plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$hp, main=&#39;House power vs number of cylinders&#39;, xlab = &#39;Numer of cylinders&#39;, ylab=&#39;House power&#39;) ``` plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$hp, main=&#39;House power vs number of cylinders&#39;, xlab = &#39;Numer of cylinders&#39;, ylab=&#39;House power&#39;) Here is a good example where we can hide our code from the viewer, since it isn’t most interesting bit about this data. Let’s turn echo=FALSE options for all our plots below. Properly labelled plots are very informative, let’s do that as well, starting with a title main=\"Travelling speed vs Breaking distance\" and then labelling axis, x xlab=\"Travelling speed (mhp)\" and y ylab=\"Stopping distance (ft)\" We are no longer seeing the code, rather just the figure. You can try eval = FALSE by yourself to see what happens. 5.2 Figures related chunk options fig.align - left, right, center or default (left) fig.height - height specified in inches fig.width - width specified in inches fig.cap - string of text in quotes Let me show you a how to resize the plot with fig.height and fig.width and then we are going to do a challenge. ```{r fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4} plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$hp, main=&#39;House power vs number of cylinders&#39;, xlab = &#39;Numer of cylinders&#39;, ylab=&#39;House power&#39;) ``` plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$hp, main=&#39;House power vs number of cylinders&#39;, xlab = &#39;Numer of cylinders&#39;, ylab=&#39;House power&#39;) Let’s try to make it very big, by trying to set height and width to 15 inches. plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$hp, main=&#39;House power vs number of cylinders&#39;, xlab = &#39;Numer of cylinders&#39;, ylab=&#39;House power&#39;) Note that we are starting to hit “boundaries” of the documents. (want to talk about the fact that plot sits inside a &lt;div&gt; box) 5.3 Challenge: code chunks 5 minutes 1. Can you align figure to the right?? fig.align = 'right' 2. Align figure to the center and add figure legend fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Figure 1: blah' 3. Can you add some emphasis to figure legend, e.g make important parts bold or underlined? Remember that figure legend is just a string of text and any text can be marked 5.4 More useful chunk options I’m going to share a few more useful code chunks, some are cosmetic, some you may never use, but hey can be handy in making your document visually different. prompt=FALSE i.e mimic consosle comment= remove hash symbol at the front of the output child= path to another Rmd file warning=FALSE messages=FALSE For this example I’m going to use simple for loop. We are going to use this variable sentence &lt;- c(\"Let\", \"the\", \"computer\", \"do\", \"the\", \"work\") ```{r} sentence &lt;- c(&#39;Let&#39;, &#39;the&#39;, &#39;computer&#39;, &#39;do&#39;, &#39;the&#39;, &#39;work&#39;) for(word in sentence){ print(word) } ``` sentence &lt;- c(&quot;Let&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;computer&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;work&quot;) for(word in sentence){ print(word) } ## [1] &quot;Let&quot; ## [1] &quot;the&quot; ## [1] &quot;computer&quot; ## [1] &quot;do&quot; ## [1] &quot;the&quot; ## [1] &quot;work&quot; Let’s add prompt=TRUE &gt; sentence &lt;- c(&quot;Let&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;computer&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;work&quot;) &gt; &gt; for(word in sentence){ + print(word) + } ## [1] &quot;Let&quot; ## [1] &quot;the&quot; ## [1] &quot;computer&quot; ## [1] &quot;do&quot; ## [1] &quot;the&quot; ## [1] &quot;work&quot; Now let’s add an external Rmd content into this file using child option ```{r child = &#39;child_chunk_example.Rmd&#39;} sentence &lt;- c(&#39;Let&#39;, &#39;the&#39;, &#39;computer&#39;, &#39;do&#39;, &#39;the&#39;, &#39;work&#39;) for(word in sentence){ print(word) } ``` START of lonely file 5.4.1 Stand alone Rmarkdown file a &lt;- c(1, 1) b &lt;- c(1, 2) cor(a, b) ## Warning in cor(a, b): the standard deviation is zero ## [1] NA I’m a very lonely Rmarkdown file, can somebody include me in? Cheer, Rmd END of lonely file 5.5 Challenge: more code chunks 5 minutes 1. Add library(tidyverse) to get lots of messages and try to suppress them with chunk options message = FALSE 2. In the example about child_chunk_example.R gives warning messages, can you suppress them from the output message = FALSE 5.6 References Section 2.6 Pimp my RMD "],
["yaml-header-1.html", "6 YAML header 6.1 R slides - ioslides 6.2 Extras", " 6 YAML header At the very top of your .Rmd file you can, optionaly, include YAML block. In this block you can fine turn your output document, add some metadata and change document’s font and theme. You can also pass additional files such as stylesheet file .css and bibliography file .bib for text citation. I’m only going to show you a few possible options and will let you explore the rest on your own. Navigate to the top of your .Rmd document and find YAML section there. Just like with the options we passed in to manipulate R code block, YAML block also has key = value pairs, but instead they are separated by colon ( : ). Now let’s add table of content to our document, this will make it easier to navigate your page as well as give nice over view of the content our key is toc with value true or yes which one you prefer better. --- title: &quot;Hello world&quot; author: &quot;Kirill&quot; date: &quot;13 July 2016&quot; output: html_document: toc: true --- Note that you need to bring html_document onto new line and indent it with two spaces. html_document is a value of output key. output can have other values e.g pdf_document, word_document. However html_document also becomes a key for toc value and toc becames a key for its own value. Now that we have sort it initial YAML layout we can continue adding more options to style our HTML document. The other two useful options that I like to pass in are toc_depth and number_sections --- title: &quot;Hello world&quot; author: &quot;Kirill&quot; date: &quot;13 July 2016&quot; output: html_document: toc: true toc_depth: 4 number_sections: yes --- Most of those options are self explanatory. They best way to learn what each does, is to pass them in. Note that you can comment lines out inside YAML section with # symbol. The last two options that can change your document apperance are theme and highlight. There are nubmer of different themes and highlight options. I suggest you find the one you like in your own time. 6.1 R slides - ioslides As I mentioned in previous section, output has many options, one of which is ioslides_presentation. You can simple add --- output: ioslides_presentation --- at the top of your document and your .Rmd files will be complied to slide presentation instead. Another options is select presentation options when you were opening R markdown file. Either way you’ll notice YAML header reflects your selected output type. Let’s open new R markdown document and let’s select presentation instead and let’s select HTML (ioslides) option there. You can still save your files as .Rmd, and then press the the Knit HTML button. The syntax for the document is more or less the same, expcept ## is now used to mark new slide. 6.2 Extras This is mainly to talk about Rnotebook and give you some extra tips about it. Hopefully this will grow into section of it own in the near future. to turn inline output (defualt behaviour) on R markdown documents on/off through settings, Chunk output inline / Chunk output in console Output doesn’t go to Viewer/Plots pane, it stays inside the notebook Working directory is the location of Rmd file. (I think changing directory with in the chunk isn’t good idea) In general Rnotebook meant to have better error handling, sends one line at a time for execution, compare to all lines for Rmarkdown document "],

If collapsed initially, the TOC is automatically expanded inline when necessary. smooth_scroll (defaults to TRUE) controls whether page scrolls are animated when TOC items are navigated to via mouse clicks. --- title: &quot;Habits&quot; output: html_document: toc: true toc_float: collapsed: false smooth_scroll: false --- 9.1 Tabbed sections ## Quarterly Results {.tabset} ### By Product (tab content) ### By Region (tab content) ## Quarterly Results {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 9.2 How documents looks theme highlight default tango pygments kate monochrome espresso zenburn haddock textmate null 9.3 Figure options via yaml This sounds interesting ok, I’ve tested out and fig_height and width via yaml do the same thing as when passed through chunk options.
