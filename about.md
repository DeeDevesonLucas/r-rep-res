## Workshop description

This workshop is an introduction to writing and communicating using Rmarkdown and shiny applications. Rmarkdown is an easy way to create documents that include your R code and its output such figure and tables. Rmarkdown documents can be "knitted" and shared as various document types such as PDF and HTML. Rmarkdown supports scientific writing such as use of citations and figure cross-referencing. Rmarkdown can also be used to create presentations that include your R code and its output. We will also cover bookdown, which is an extension to Rmarkdown that allows creation of larger documents such as books with multiple chapters.

Shiny applications are a more advanced way of sharing your analysis. Shiny applications will enable you to to turn your static R code into dynamic applications with toggle and buttons that can be shared with the world.

 You will get an exposure to writing and publishing your apps online. Shiny apps are very powerful way to simplify your workflow, enable less technical people (yet) to run your analysis without much extra effort, all staying within an R ecosystem. 

 You will need prior experience in R in order to participate.
