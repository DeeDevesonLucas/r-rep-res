> - Level: beginner-intermediate
> - Duration: 5 hours
> - Student numbers: 25-30

## Learning outcomes:

Attendees will learn how to:

- write Rmarkdown and bookdown documents
- use Rmarkdown to produce different document types including PDF, HTML and DOCX
- include citations in Rmarkdown documents
- create presentations including R code using Rmarkdown
- write shiny applications, which allows your R code to be used by others over the web
- write the two different parts of a shiny application, the user interface and the server R code

## Workshop description

This workshop is an introduction to writing and communicating using Rmarkdown and shiny applications. Rmarkdown is an easy way to create documents that include your R code and its output such figure and tables. Rmarkdown documents can be "knitted" and shared as various document types such as PDF and HTML. Rmarkdown supports scientific writing such as use of citations and figure cross-referencing. Rmarkdown can also be used to create presentations that include your R code and its output. We will also cover bookdown, which is an extension to Rmarkdown that allows creation of larger documents such as books with multiple chapters.

Shiny applications are a more advanced way of sharing your analysis. By using shiny you create web applications without leaving the R ecosystem. Shiny enables you to turn your static R code into dynamic applications with toggles and buttons that can be shared with the world. By writing shiny applications you empower other people to explore your data interactively.

This is an introductory level workshop, however some prior exposure to R is assumed.
