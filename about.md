## Description

This workshop is an introduction to writing and communicating using Rmarkdown and shiny applications. While each one of those can be used separately together they can make any analysis highly reproducible, sharable and well presented. As will be discussed in the opening of the workshop Rmarkdown is an extension of an original markdown, which really augments an R language and adds nice features for the analysis reproducibility and sharibility. Rmarkdown is widely used for inline analysis documentation and papers writing just to name a couple. You will also get an exposure to a bookdown a further extension that without much more effort enables can turn your Rmarkdown into a book. Bookdown has become very popular in recent year in many communities including communities outside of R ecosystem .  
Shiny application is a more advanced way of sharing your analysis. You will need prior experience in R in order to participate. Shiny applications will enable you to to turn your static R code into dynamic application with toggle and buttons that can be shared with the world. You will get an exposure to writing and publishing your apps online. Shiny apps are very powerful way to simplify your workflow, enable less technical people (yet) to run your analysis without much extra effort, all staying within an R ecosystem.
