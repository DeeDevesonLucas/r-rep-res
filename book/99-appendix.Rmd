## Long list of chunk options

```{r echo = F, message = F}
chunks <- readr::read_tsv("supplementary/chunk_options.tsv") %>%
		select(-this)
chunks %>% kable
```

## Citation

### Yaml header

You can also include citation into yaml header e.g

```
references:
- id: fenner2012a
  title: One-click science marketing
  author:
  - family: Fenner
    given: Martin
  container-title: Nature Materials
  volume: 11
  URL: 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat3283'
  DOI: 10.1038/nmat3283
  issue: 4
  publisher: Nature Publishing Group
  page: 261-263
  type: article-journal
  issued:
    year: 2012
    month: 3
```

While this is handy for one or two citation, but this isn't practical for a study that has more then a few citations.

### Changing citation style

Apparently if you go [here](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) and download individual `.csl` files, specific for your citation style you then should be able to reference that file in yaml header

```
---
csl: "harvard-anglia-ruskin-university.csl"
---
```

OR

```
---
citation-style: "harvard-anglia-ruskin-university.csl"
---
```

This is explained [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#yaml-header)

However I wasn't able to change my style. I suspect there are some subtleties between bookdown and rmarkdown specifically `html_docment` and `html_docment2` outputs

[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48965247/use-csl-file-for-pdf-output-in-bookdown) meant to be the solution by using

```
---
pandoc_args: [--csl=harvard-anglia-ruskin-university.csl]
---
```

But that also didn't work for me.

Also note that `biblio-style` ["only applied to LaTeX output. For other output formats, you need to use the csl option in YAML or --csl in pandoc_args:"](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/354)

```
---
biblio-style: apalike
---
```

### BibTex

This is a good [resource](http://bib-it.sourceforge.net/help/fieldsAndEntryTypes.php) for manual bibtex curation.

## Git and GitHub

A brief note about README files. It is regarded as a "silent" way of communication, where you can tell all necessary information another person need to know about your project. For a software tool you would put information about how to build that particular tool and dependencies. In our case we will add information how to build final html report. We will do this a bit later in the workshop.
