Welcome to the [Reproducible Research in R (RRR)](https://github.com/MonashDataFluency/r-rep-res) workshop. The main aim of this workshop is to set you on the right path of making your research more reproducible and shariable. Reproducible research means that future you and anyone else will be able to pick up your analysis and reproduce the same results including figures and tables. Reproducible research also implies well documented reasearch, your code should be well commented and the reasons behind functions and methods should be well explained through out the analysis. The communication aspect should not be after thought, is should stay with your analysis as you are going through it. Rmarkdown is a way of [literal programing](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf) that keeps code and words and sentences together. The other important aspect that goes hand and hand with reproducibility is ability to easily collaborate and share your analysis. We are going to repurpose git version cotrol tool and leverage GitHub remote hosting provider for managing and sharining our work. Git + GitHub will provide very powerful way for global collaboration and exposure of your work. In this workshop we are going to verstion control our work and push it to github, which can then be accessible by your collaborators and supervisors. Git + GitHub should become integral part of your workflow.

The RRR course given by the [Monash Bioinformatics Platform](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics) for the [Monash Data Fluency](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/) initiative. Our teaching style is based on the style of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

## Learning outcomes {-}

Attendees will learn how to:

- write vanilla markdown, Rmarkdown and bookdown documents
- use `knitr`, `rmarkdown` and `bookdown` R packages to build various document types including PDF, HTML and DOCX
- create reproducible Rmarkdown documents leveraging `.Rproj` and `.RData`
- include inline citation and full references list in to Rmarkdown document using `.bib` files
- create presentations from Rmarkdown documents that include R code
- work with `git` version control tool
- create reproducible and "backed up" analysis via remote repositories (e.g github)

## Workshop description {-}

This workshop is an introduction to writing and communicating research using Rmarkdown. Rmarkdown is an easy way to create documents that include your R code and its output such figure and tables. Rmarkdown is a single documents that can be "knitted" and shared as various document types such as PDF and HTML. Rmarkdown supports scientific writing such as use of citations and figure cross-referencing. Rmarkdown can also be used to create presentations that include your R code and its output. We will also cover bookdown, which is an extension to Rmarkdown that allows creation of larger documents such as books with multiple chapters.

In this workshop we will also cover [git version control tool](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) that can help with organising and "checkpointing" Rmarkdown documents, associated R code and data. Git is not a back up system, but it does allow one to retrieve older versions of your work. Git together with remote repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com) can provide centralised location for your research. All together Rmarkdown, git and github can enable reproducible research that is visiable and accessible by greater public including supervisors and management.

## Prerequisite {-}

This is an introductory level workshop, however some prior exposure to R and familiarity with RStudio is assumed. It is highly recomended that you read [this article in full](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/), if you have to prioritise, read at least these section (1,2,6,10).
