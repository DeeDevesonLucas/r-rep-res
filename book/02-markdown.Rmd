# Vanilla Markdown

The original (vanilla) version of Markdown invented by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) defines a handful of tags, [discussed next](#vanilla-tags). Markdown is a relatively small and simple language for writing plain text documents that are easy-to-write and easy-to-read, but it is greatly enhanced and extended by pandoc tool.

## Vanilla tags

Let's open our first Markdown file.

```
File
 └── New File
        └── R Markdown

title = "Learning Rmarkdown"
author = "Me"
```

- select document type **HTML**
- to build (compile) the document press `knitr` button or `ctrl+alt+k`
- to save as `.Rmd` file

Since we are using RStudio and R, it is inevitable that we will be using Rmarkdown flavour, but we can write vanilla markdown because under the hood Rmarkdown will always be converted to vanilla markdown.

From now on we are going to start using `knitr` to compile Rmarkdown into html. Remember from the [Rmarkdown ecosystem]() that `knitr` will convert Rmarkdown to markdown and `rmarkdown` R package will convert - render markdown files into html. By pressing that blue button both things will happen automatically and we don't need to think about, but I wanted you to know that.

These are essentially all core (vanilla) markdown tags. Let's practice writing them.

```
# Header1
## Header2
### Header3

Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

Two spaces at the end of a line
produces a line break.

Text attributes _italic_,
**bold**, `monospace`.

Horizontal rule:

---

Bullet list:

  * apples
  * oranges
  * pears

Numbered list:

  1. wash
  2. rinse
  3. repeat

> characters for blockquoting.
```

## Practice vanilla markdown

Now, it's just a matter of learning some of the markdown syntax. Let's delete all current text from the opened document except the YAML header and type this new text: `Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !` and press the `knit HTML` button.


```
Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
```

Not much happened. This is because we didn't mark our text in any way. You can put as much text as you want and it will appear as is, unless "specially" marked to look different.

Now add the `#` symbol at the start of the line and press the `knit HTML` button again. We'll be pressing this button a lot! For those who like keyboard short cuts use `ctrl+shift+k` instead.

```
# Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
```

How about now? A single hash symbol made it a whole lot bigger didn't it? We've marked this whole line to be the header line.

Now make three new lines with the same text, but different numbers of `#` symbols, one, two and three respectively and keep pressing the `Knit HTML` button


```
# Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
## Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
### Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
```

This is how you can specify different headers type using markdown.

**Remember** that [vanilla markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is comprised entirely of punctuation characters.

    2. Can markdown replace [html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (discussion question)?
  </summary>
  It has replaced html and latex in documentation and communication of results. My feeling is that the data science ecosystem heavily revolves around markdown. But html, pdf and latex, in this context, are simply communication and sharing mediums.
  On would not want to replace html + css for large website projects.
