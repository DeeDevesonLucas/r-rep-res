# Vanilla Markdown

The original (vanilla) version of Markdown invented by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) defines a handful of tags, [discussed next](#vanilla-tags). Markdown is relativelly small and simple language for writing plain text documents that are easy-to-write and easy-to-read, but it is greatly enhanced and extended by pandoc tool.

## Vanilla tags

Let's open our first Markdown file.

```
File
 └── New File
        └── R Markdown

title = "Learning Rmarkdown"
author = "Me"
```

- select document type **HTML**
- to build (compile) the document press `knitr` button or `ctrl+alt+k`
- to save as `.Rmd` file

Since we are using RStudio and R it is inevitable that will be using Rmarkdown flaour, but we can still write only vanilla markdown and remember that under the hood Rmarkdown will always be converted to vanilla markdown.

From now onward we are going to start using `knitr` to complie Rmarkdown into html. Remember from the [Rmarkdown ecosystem]() that `knitr` will convert Rmarkdown to markdonw and `rmarkdown` R package will convert - render markdown file into html. By pressing that blue button both things will happen automatically and we don't need to think about, but I wanted you to know that.

These are essintially all core (vanilla) markdown tags. Let's practice writting them.

```
# Header1
## Header2
### Header3

Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

Two spaces at the end of a line
produces a line break.

Text attributes _italic_,
**bold**, `monospace`.

Horizontal rule:

---

Bullet list:

  * apples
  * oranges
  * pears

Numbered list:

  1. wash
  2. rinse
  3. repeat

> Markdown uses email-style
> characters for blockquoting.
```

## Practice vanilla markdown

Now it's just a matter of learning some of the markdown syntax. Let's delete all current text from the opened document except the YAML header and type this new text in `Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !` and pressing the `knit HTML` button.


```
Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
```

Not much happened. This is because we didn't mark our text in any way. You can put as much text as you want and it will appear as is, unless "specially" marked to look differently.

Now add the `#` symbol at the start of the line and press the `knit HTML` button again. We'll be pressing this button a lot! For those who like keyboard short cuts use `ctrl+shift+k` instead.

```
# Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
```

How about now? A single hash symbol made it whole lot bigger didn't it? We've marked this whole line to be the header line.

Now make three new lines with the same text, but different numbers of `#` symbols, one, two and three respectively and keep pressing the `Knit HTML` button


```
# Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
## Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
### Hello world, I'm learning R markdown !
```

This is how you can specify different headers type using markdown.

**Remember** that [vanilla markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is comprised entirely of punctuation characters.

    2. Can markdown replace [html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (discussion question)?
  </summary>
  It has replaced html and latex in documention and communication of results. My feeling is that data science ecosystem heavily rotates around markdown. But html, pdf and latex in this context are simply communication and sharing medium.
  On would not want to replace html + css for large website project
