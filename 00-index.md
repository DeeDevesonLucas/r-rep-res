## Learning outcomes

Attendees will learn how to:

- write vanilla markdown, Rmarkdown and bookdown documents
- use `knitr`, `rmarkdown` and `bookdown` R packages to build various document types including PDF, HTML and DOCX
- create reproducible Rmarkdown documents leveraging `.Rproj` and `.RData`
- include inline citation and full references list in to Rmarkdown document using `.bib` files
- create presentations from Rmarkdown documents that include R code
- work with `git` version control tool
- create reproducible and "backed up" analysis via remote repositories (e.g github)

## Workshop description

This workshop is an introduction to writing and communicating research using Rmarkdown. Rmarkdown is an easy way to create documents that include your R code and its output such figure and tables. Rmarkdown is a single documents that can be "knitted" and shared as various document types such as PDF and HTML. Rmarkdown supports scientific writing such as use of citations and figure cross-referencing. Rmarkdown can also be used to create presentations that include your R code and its output. We will also cover bookdown, which is an extension to Rmarkdown that allows creation of larger documents such as books with multiple chapters.

In this workshop we will also cover [git version control tool](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) that can help with organising and "checkpointing" Rmarkdown documents, associated R code and data. Git is not a back up system, but it does allow one to retrieve older versions of your work. Git together with remote repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com) can provide centralised location for your research. All together Rmarkdown, git and github can enable reproducible research that is visiable and accessible by greater public including supervisors and management.
